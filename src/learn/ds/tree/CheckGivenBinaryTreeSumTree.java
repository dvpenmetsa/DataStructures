 * Check if a given Binary Tree is SumTree Write a function that returns true if the given Binary Tree is SumTree else false.
 *
 * A SumTree is a Binary Tree where the value of a node is equal to sum of the nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree.
 *
 * An empty tree is SumTree and sum of an empty tree can be considered as 0. A leaf node is also considered as SumTree.
 *
 * Following is an example of SumTree.
