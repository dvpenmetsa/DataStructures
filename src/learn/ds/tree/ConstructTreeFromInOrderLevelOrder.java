 *
 * Given inorder and level-order traversals of a Binary Tree, construct the Binary Tree.
 * Following is an example to illustrate the problem.
 *
 * Input:
 * Two arrays that represent Inorder and level order traversals of a Binary Tree
 *  in[]    = {4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 22};
 *  level[] = {20, 8, 22, 4, 12, 10, 14};
 *
 * Output:
 * Inorder traversal of the constructed tree is 4 8 10 12 14 20 22
