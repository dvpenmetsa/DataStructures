 * Check if a binary tree is subtree of another binary tree
 *
 * Given two binary trees, check if the first tree is subtree of the second one. A subtree of a tree T is a tree S consisting of a
 * node in T and all of its descendants in T.
 *
 * The subtree corresponding to the root node is the entire tree; the subtree corresponding to any other node is called a proper subtree.
 *
 * For example, in the following case, Tree1 is a subtree of Tree2.
 *
 *
 *         Tree 2
 *           10
 *         /    \
 *       4       6
 *        \
 *         30
 *
 *
 *            Tree 1
 *               26
 *             /   \
 *           10     3
 *         /    \     \
 *       4       6      3
 *        \
